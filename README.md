# Da-Goat-Network-Tool

## Overview
Welcome to the **Da-Goat-Network-Tool**, a comprehensive network analysis suite crafted with precision and innovation by **Team 12, the IDS Sorcerers**, for the 2nd Ghabgathon 2024, hosted by KCST. Engineered to address the multifaceted challenges of network security, our suite integrates advanced tools including a Network Scanner, Packet Sniffer, Packet Analyzer, and a robust NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection System) with both misuse and anomaly detection capabilities. Harnessing the power of AI and ML algorithms, combined with cutting-edge data analytics methodologies like decision trees, neural networks, and Weka, we offer an unparalleled solution in network security :)

## Project Description

### Problem Statement
In the ever-evolving digital age, networks face increasing vulnerabilities to a diverse range of security threats. With cyber-attacks growing in sophistication, traditional security tools lag in providing the necessary defense, highlighting the urgent need for a more dynamic and comprehensive approach.

### Proposed Solution
The Da-Goat-Network-Tool emerges as a beacon of innovation, delivering a multifaceted network security solution. By seamlessly integrating network scanning, packet sniffing, packet analyzing, and intrusion detection, our tool offers an exhaustive analysis of network traffic. It adeptly identifies potential vulnerabilities through misuse and anomaly detection with success rate reaches +95%, while the server-based NIDS component further elevates security measures by incorporating firewall functionalities and advanced threat classification techniques.

## Libraries and Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python and Javascript.
- **ANOMILY and MISUSE Based IDS**: decision trees and neural networks, pandass, numpy, concurrent.features, math, tensorflow, csv, rrnf, threading, typing, dict, Scikit-learn(sklearn), Weka.
- **Server Based IDS**: optparse, os, platform, threading, time, traceback, threading, struct, socket, re, platform, optparse, mmap, inspect, cProfile
- **Packet Analysis**: pyshark, custom tkinter, threading, massege box, metasploit, beautiful soup, psutil, subprocess.
- **Network Scanning and Packet Sniffing**: Developed with Python's Scapy library.
- **Operating System for Development**: Windows (10 Pro).

## Datasets Used
- All datasets used in the ANOMILY and MISUSE Based IDS are available on its data folder
## Features
- **Packet Sniffer**: Captures packets from any selected network adapter, preserving data for subsequent analysis.
- **Packet Analyzer**: Delivers comprehensive packet analysis with sophisticated filtering capabilities, powered by Wireshark.
- **Network Scanner**: Efficiently scans and catalogs all devices and services within a network.
- **NIDS**: Features a dual-mode Intrusion Detection System for both misuse and anomaly detection, complemented by a server-based NIDS for an exhaustive traffic analysis, classification, and representation (IDS with accuracy rates of 94.4% for misuse detection and 99.0% for anomaly detection

).

## Supported Operating Systems
- Linux
- Windows 10 and above
- MacOS (Mojave and above)

## Future Enhancements
- Expanding integration with cloud-based services for real-time threat intelligence sharing.
- Advancing AI models to further refine detection accuracy.
- Developing a user-friendly dashboard for enriched real-time monitoring and alerting capabilities.
- Expanding integration with blockchain by using blockchain consensu merkle tree root hash. Consensus mechanisms like Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS) ensure the immutability and reliability of the data.

## Challenges Faced
- Integrating a comprehensive suite like the Da-Goat-Network-Tool posed significant challenges, especially in harmonizing diverse components into a unified platform within 2days frame. Our pursuit of precise threat detection with minimal false positives demanded relentless testing and meticulous refinement of our AI and ML models. Effective collaboration and communication within our diverse team were instrumental in navigating these hurdles successfully.
